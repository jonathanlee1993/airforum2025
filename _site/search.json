    "text": "This project investigates the relationships between student usage of the University of West Florida (UWF) Health Leisure and Sports (HLS) Facility recreation center, group fitness activities, and intramural sports participation with student performance indicators such as full-time first time in college (FTIC) four year graduation rate and full-time FTIC academic progress rate (defined as a student being enrolled in the second fall with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher) using logistic regression. The goal is to identify the strength of any existing relationships between those students performance indicators with any HLS usage data, after taking a variety of student demographic and performance factors into account.\nTo improve model performance and handle potential class imbalance, we apply hyperparameter tuning using the `tidymodels` framework and evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics.\nThis guide is written as a reproducible Quarto document for sharing, documentation, and educational purposes."

These outputs provide transparency into the modelâ€™s underlying statistical relationships.\nTo interpret feature importance, we extracted the fitted engine from each workflow and visualized variable influence using the vip package.

    "text": "Hyperparameter Tuning\nTo optimize model performance for the APR prediction scenario, we implemented hyperparameter tuning for the under_ratio parameter within the step_downsample() function from the themis package. This parameter controls the ratio of the minority to majority class after downsampling and plays a critical role in addressing class imbalance in logistic regression.\nA regular grid search was performed over 50 values of under_ratio, ranging from 0.1 to 5.0. We used 10-fold cross-validation with a fixed seed to ensure consistent and repeatable results across runs. For each fold, a modified recipe was constructed, integrating step_downsample() with a tunable parameter, and embedded into a workflow object for seamless integration with model training.\nThe tune_grid() function from the tune package was used to evaluate model performance across a range of classification metrics including:\n\nAccuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1 Score\nROC AUC\n\nWe collected all tuning results and identified the best-performing under_ratio value for each metric using select_best(). These optimal values were summarized both in tabular and graphical formats. The resulting plot shows performance across metrics as a function of the under-sampling ratio, with tooltips providing precise values for interactive inspection using ggplotly(). This step helped us balance predictive performance and fairness across multiple evaluation dimensions, ensuring the model is not just accurate but also well-calibrated for imbalanced data.\n\n\nShow Code\n# * For the step_downsample under_ratio argument ----\n\n# *** Set tuning grid ----\ntuning_grid <- dials::grid_regular(under_ratio(range = c(0.1, 5)), levels = 50)\n\ntune_obj <- student_data_tbl %>% \n  filter(DEP_VAR == \"APR\") %>% \n  \n  select(DEP_VAR, data_train_tbl) %>% \n  mutate(\n    \n    # *** Setting up 10-Fold Cross-Validation ----\n    CV_FOLDS = map2(\n      data_train_tbl, DEP_VAR,\n      function(.data_train_tbl, .DEP_VAR) {\n        set.seed(123)\n        rsample::vfold_cv(.data_train_tbl)\n      }\n    ),\n    # *** Update recipe to set under_ratio parameter to tune() ----\n    TUNE_RECIPE  = map2(\n      data_train_tbl, DEP_VAR,\n      ~\n        recipe(\n          reformulate(\n            response = .y, \n            termlabels = .x %>% select(-all_of(.y)) %>% names()\n          ), \n          data = .x\n        ) %>%\n        step_nzv(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>%\n        step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>%\n        step_impute_mode(all_nominal_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>%\n        step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n        themis::step_downsample(all_of(.y), under_ratio = tune::tune()) %>% \n        step_zv(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>%\n        step_center(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n        step_scale(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes())\n    ),\n    # *** Update workflow with the updated recipe ----\n    TUNE_WORKFLOW = map(\n      TUNE_RECIPE, ~workflow() %>% \n        add_recipe(.x) %>% \n        add_model(logistic_model)\n    ),\n    # *** Run tuning grid ----\n    TUNE_RESULTS  = map2(\n      TUNE_WORKFLOW, CV_FOLDS,\n      function(.TUNE_WORKFLOW, .CV_FOLDS) {\n        set.seed(123)\n        tune::tune_grid(\n          .TUNE_WORKFLOW,\n          resamples = .CV_FOLDS,\n          grid      = tuning_grid,\n          metrics   = yardstick::metric_set(\n            yardstick::roc_auc,\n            yardstick::accuracy,\n            yardstick::precision,\n            yardstick::recall,\n            yardstick::f_meas\n          )\n        )\n      }\n    )\n    \n  )\n\ntuning_eval_obj <- tune_obj %>% \n  \n  mutate(\n    # *** Collect metrics from tuning ----\n    TUNING_METRICS  = map(\n      TUNE_RESULTS, workflowsets::collect_metrics\n    ),\n    # *** Filter to the best value of under-sample ratio for each metric ----\n    BEST_OF_METRICS = map2(\n      TUNING_METRICS, TUNE_RESULTS, function(.tuning_metrics, .tune_results) .tuning_metrics %>% \n        nest(data = -.metric) %>% \n        mutate(\n          test = map(.metric, function(.y) tune::select_best(.tune_results, metric = .y))\n        ) %>% \n        select(.metric, test) %>% \n        unnest(everything())\n    ),\n    BEST_OF_METRICS_TABLE = map(\n      BEST_OF_METRICS, \n      ~uwfir::models_general_create_datatable(\n        .x, \"Best Tuning Parameters\", round = 5, `Under Ratio` = \"under_ratio\", Metric = \".metric\", Config = \".config\"\n      )\n    ) ,\n    BEST_OF_METRICS_PLOT  = map(\n      TUNING_METRICS, ~.x %>%\n        mutate(\n          .metric = case_when(\n            .metric == \"accuracy\"  ~ \"Accuracy\",\n            .metric == \"f_meas\"    ~ \"F1-Score\",\n            .metric == \"precision\" ~ \"Precision\",\n            .metric == \"recall\"    ~ \"Recall\",\n            .metric == \"roc_auc\"   ~ \"ROC Area Under Curve\"\n          ),\n          across(mean, as.numeric),\n          .tooltip = str_glue(\n            \"Under-sample Ratio: {under_ratio}\n            {.metric}: {round(mean, 2)}\"\n          )\n        ) %>%\n        ggplot(aes(x = under_ratio, y = mean, group = .metric, color = .metric, text = .tooltip)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        geom_line() +\n        facet_wrap(~ .metric, scales = \"free_y\") +\n        labs(\n          x = \"Under-sampling Ratio\", \n          y = \"Metric Value\", \n          title = \"Performance vs. Under-sampling Ratio for Various Metrics\"\n        ) +\n        tidyquant::theme_tq() +\n        tidyquant::scale_fill_tq() +\n        tidyquant::scale_color_tq() +\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n    ),\n    BEST_OF_METRICS_PLOTLY = map(BEST_OF_METRICS_PLOT, ~ggplotly(.x, tooltip = \".tooltip\")),\n    TUNING_METRICS         = map(\n      TUNING_METRICS, ~uwfir::models_general_create_datatable(\n        .x, \"All Tuning Parameters\", round = 5\n      )\n    )\n    \n  )"

    "text": "Update Model Recipe\nFollowing hyperparameter tuning, we re-specified and re-fitted the models to incorporate the optimal under-sampling ratios identified for each APR analysis. This step ensures that final model estimates reflect the most effective class balance strategy, rather than the default or untuned approach.\nTwo of the three modelsâ€”those predicting APRâ€”were refit with distinct under_ratio values based on our results (though of course these values will almost certainly differ from what you see with your data):\n\nThe APR_GYM_SWIPES model was assigned an under_ratio of 3.9.\nThe APR_NO_GYM model used a more balanced value of 1.4.\n\nThese ratios were incorporated into the preprocessing recipe via the step_downsample() function. The third model, which predicts four-year graduation rate, was not refit with a downsampling step, as class imbalance was not present and not a priority for that outcome.\nTo facilitate the refit, we created a new object that preserved only the essential data elements (e.g., training and test sets) and removed outputs from the prior modeling steps. Each modelâ€™s recipe was updated accordingly, and new workflows were constructed and applied to regenerate baked training and test datasets. This process maintains consistency with earlier modeling logic while explicitly embedding the tuned parameter values for improved performance and fairness.\n\n\nShow Code\n# Recipe is the same as before but we add the step_downsample value for selected modeling scenarios.
